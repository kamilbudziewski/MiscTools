LargeDirectoryCleaner is a tool created to help deleting humongous directories. I created it because windows failed to delete directory with above 15 milion files in it (in subdirectories). It iterates through given directory and deletes all files and subdirectories in it.

##Usage:

`LargeDirectoryCleaner.exe -d "DirectoryPath"`
